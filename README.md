# Spell-Checker-on-QNX-RTOS-



This project implements a spell checker on a QNX target system, designed as a programming exercise focusing on efficient memory management and real-time performance analysis.

Core functionality: Reads text input, checks spelling against a dictionary.

Performance measurement: Utilizes QNX timing APIs to measure execution (analysis) time for benchmarking.

Optimization focus: Minimal memory footprint through efficient data structures and careful resource handling, suitable for embedded or constrained environments.

Target platform: QNX Neutrino RTOS.
